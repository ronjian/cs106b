As [the ticket](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3683602/single-quotes-vs-double-quotes-in-c-or-c) mentioned:
>In C and in C++ single quotes identify a single character, while double quotes create a string literal. 'a' is a single a character literal, while "a" is a string literal containing an 'a' and a null terminator (that is a 2 char array).
